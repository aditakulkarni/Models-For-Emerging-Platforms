Description and Scaling:

As the number of readers are increased, the number of words added are also increased.
As the number of askers  are increased, the number of queries made are increased.
As the greater number of readers and writers cause increase in the count of words added and queries made, the time required for execution also increases.

The projects scales by using Buffer Sizes for Readers [32] and Askers [8], so that each of them do not wait for the channel to be empty to write in. 
Secondly the Listen() uses Select which does not block for a particular request. Instead executes the one which is ready.
